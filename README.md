# gigya
This is a patched gigya for drupal 7 and drupal 8. Since pantheon has a limitation for reading $_COOKIE via PHP. 

The GConnector is a module for Drupal 7 and 8 it allows you to easily integrate Gigya's Customer Identity in your Drupal site. With the GConnector, you can easily implement such features as registration, authentication, profile management, data analytics and third-party integrations. Increase registration rates and identify customers across devices, consolidate data into rich customer profiles, and provide better service, products and experiences by integrating data into marketing and service applications. 

Gigya has two types of session dynamic and fixed. When using dynamic session based the gigya connector is not working, that patch fixes that issue.
